# Future Plans and Ambitions for Mongo-Elastic-Sync

## Vision
This project aims to provide an efficient and real-time synchronization between MongoDB and Elasticsearch with the flexibility to write data directly to Elasticsearch or use log forwarding tools like Filebeat/Logstash. The project will be open-sourced and packaged into an npm module for easy integration into various Node.js applications.

## Planned Features:

### 1. **Token Mechanism for Resume After a Crash**  
   **Priority**: High  
   **Description**: A token mechanism will be implemented to ensure that the sync process can resume from the last processed change after a crash or restart. This will help avoid data duplication or missed updates by keeping track of the changes that have been processed.  
   **Benefit**: Ensures data consistency and allows the system to recover gracefully from failures.

### 2. **npm Package**  
   **Priority**: High  
   **Description**: The core functionality of this project will be packaged into an npm module. This will make it easy for other developers to integrate the sync functionality into their own Node.js applications.  
   **Benefit**: Reusability and easy integration into other projects. Expands the reach of the project to the broader JavaScript ecosystem.

### 3. **Error Handling and Retry Mechanism**  
   **Priority**: High  
   **Description**: Implementing a retry mechanism for failures such as connectivity issues or temporary downtime will improve the robustness of the sync process. It will help ensure that the system continues to operate without interruptions, even during transient errors.  
   **Benefit**: Increases system reliability and reduces the chances of data loss during temporary failures.

### 4. **Direct Writing to Elasticsearch or Using Filebeat/Logstash**  
   **Priority**: Medium  
   **Description**: Users will have the option to write the synchronized data directly to Elasticsearch or use log forwarding tools like Filebeat/Logstash. This will give users flexibility depending on their infrastructure and needs.  
   **Benefit**: Provides flexibility in how the synchronized data is handled, offering more scalable solutions with Filebeat/Logstash.

### 5. **TLS Support for MongoDB and Elasticsearch**  
   **Priority**: Medium  
   **Description**: Secure communication between MongoDB and Elasticsearch will be enabled through TLS (Transport Layer Security). This will ensure that all data transmitted between the two systems is encrypted.  
   **Benefit**: Adds a layer of security, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected while in transit.

### 6. **Flexible Configuration (e.g., Filtering Changes, Interval Settings)**  
   **Priority**: Medium  
   **Description**: The ability to filter the changes being synced (e.g., sync only specific fields or collections) and configure sync intervals will be added. This feature will be especially useful in environments with high data volume or when users want fine-grained control over the sync process.  
   **Benefit**: Increases flexibility and allows users to customize the sync process based on their specific needs.
